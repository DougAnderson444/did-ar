# DID:AR Component

Enables users to create a smart contract on Arweave to store their Decentralized Identity Document (DID Doc).

# Forking The Smart Contract

With Arweave, using Warp Contract's `deployFromSourceTx` you can use an existing deployed contract and add your own initial state to make a new DID Doc.
